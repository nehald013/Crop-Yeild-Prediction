Crop Yield Prediction Using SARIMAX (2025–2030)

This project focuses on forecasting crop yields using the SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors) model — a powerful time series analysis technique well suited for agricultural data.

Objective To predict future yield trends of three key crops in Maharashtra:
Bajra
Jowar
Maize
For the years 2025 to 2030, using historical crop production data.

Key Features
Time series forecasting with SARIMAX.
Data visualization using Altair, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
Interactive Streamlit web app to select crops and view predictions.

Files Included
app.py: Streamlit app code.
forecast_crops_2025_2030.csv: Forecasted crop yield data.
crop_yield_plot.py: Bar/line chart visualizations.
Tech Stack
Python
Pandas, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Streamlit
Altair
